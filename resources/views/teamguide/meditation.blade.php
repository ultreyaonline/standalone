        <h2>Meditation - Traditional</h2>

        <p>Come Holy Spirit, fill our hearts and kindle them in the fire of your love. Send forth Your Spirit and they shall be created.</p>
        <p>And You shall renew the face of the earth.</p>
        <p>O God, who by the light of the Holy Spirit instructs the hearts of the faithful, grant that by the same Holy Spirit we may be truly wise and ever rejoice in His consolation, through Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
        <p>I believe, Lord, that You are here present, although my eyes do not see You, my faith senses You. Take any stray thoughts from my mind. Make me understand the truths that You wish to teach me in this
          meditation. Let me make up my mind to put them into practice. Your servant is listening; speak O Lord to my soul.</p>
        <p>We give thanks, Lord God Almighty, for all the benefits You have given us. To You Who live and reign forever and ever. Amen.</p>

        <h2>Meditation - Alternate</h2>

<p>We invite you Holy Spirit, to open our hearts and minds to Your limitless love, grace and wisdom.</p>

<p>May we learn to trust in Your power, and Your Life within us, that we may be truly wise, always rejoicing in Your comfort and provision, through Christ our Lord.
  Amen.</p>

<p>I believe, Lord, that You are here present. Though my eyes do not see You, my heart senses You. Take any stray thoughts from my mind. Help me understand the truths that You wish to teach me. I ask You for the courage
  and power to put them into practice. I am listening; speak, O Lord, to my soul.</p>

<p>We give thanks Lord Jesus, for who You are and your perfect work of redemption in us. Glory and honour to You, the same yesterday, today and forever.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
