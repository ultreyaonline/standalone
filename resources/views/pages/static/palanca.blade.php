<p>We all remember what Palanca meant on our weekend.  To some of us it meant unconditional love from people we did not know.  To some it helped to change the hardest heart into one of love and forgiveness.  Our gifts of Palanca for the weekend may be God's way for us to minister to many candidates. You may create a Palanca blessing by yourself, but also consider working with your reunion group or a friend to enjoy fellowship while you create your Palanca.</p>
